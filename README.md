# Keygen for [Master PDF Editor](https://code-industry.net/masterpdfeditor/) 5.x

The Pascal code is written by [RadiXX11](https://radixx11rce2.blogspot.com/p/source-code.html). I test `bin\Keygen.exe` on Linux using `Wine`, it works perfectly.

To reduce security concern, I am going to rewrite this keygen in Javascript and publish it on web.

As pointed out [here](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/masterpdfeditor-libs-included/):

> I discovered that version **5.6.80** is the very last which can be registered with keygen.

All available verisons can be downloaded from: https://code-industry.ru/public/ .

## demo

Now I finish my original goal, see [demo](https://jingmatrix.github.io/articles/writings/2019-12-21-Workflow/#writing-documents) here.
