# Keygen for [Master PDF Editor](https://code-industry.net/masterpdfeditor/) 5.x

The Pascal code is written by [RadiXX11](https://radixx11rce2.blogspot.com/p/source-code.html). I test `bin\Keygen.exe` on Linux using `Wine`, it works perfectly.

To reduce security concern, I am going to rewrite this keygen in Javascript and publish it on web.

## demo

Now I finish my original goal, see [demo](https://jingmatrix.github.io/articles/writings/2019-12-21-Workflow/#writing-documents) here.

# FreePascal Support

Code in `src_fpc` can be compiled (and test) using FreePascal with command
```
cd src_fpc
fpc -Mobjfpc Keygen.pas
./Keygen
```
